= datagrid65-basic
:toc:
:toc-placement!:
:toclevels: 5

Application template for JDG 6.5 applications.

For simple authentication, set

  USERNAME=<username>
  PASSWORD=<password>

This will enable user authentication with the datagrid. Provided username and password will be used to access the cache over both HTTPS and HotRod. With this case, the user will have all permissions configured.

Restrictions for password:

  at least 8 characters
  at least 1 digit
  at least 1 non-alphanumeric symbol

== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|=======================================================================
|Variable name |Image Environment Variable |Description |Example value |Required

|`APPLICATION_NAME` | -- | The name for the application. | datagrid-app | True
|`HOSTNAME_HTTP` | -- | Custom hostname for http service route.  Leave blank for default hostname, e.g.: <application-name>-<project>.<default-domain-suffix> | -- | False
|`USERNAME` | `USERNAME` | User name for JDG user. | `${USERNAME}` | False
|`PASSWORD` | `PASSWORD` | Password for JDG user. | `${PASSWORD}` | False
|`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE` | -- | Namespace in which the ImageStreams for Red Hat Middleware images are installed. These ImageStreams are normally installed in the openshift namespace. You should only need to modify this if you've installed the ImageStreams in a different namespace/project. | openshift | True

|`CACHE_NAMES` | `CACHE_NAMES` | Comma-separated list of caches to configure.  By default, a distributed-cache, with a mode of SYNC will be configured for each entry. | `${CACHE_NAMES}` | False
|`ENCRYPTION_REQUIRE_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH` | `ENCRYPTION_REQUIRE_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH` |  | `${ENCRYPTION_REQUIRE_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH}` | False
|`MEMCACHED_CACHE` | `MEMCACHED_CACHE` | The name of the cache to expose through this memcached connector (defaults to 'default') | default | False

|`JGROUPS_CLUSTER_PASSWORD` | `PASSWORD` | JGroups cluster password | `${PASSWORD}` | True

== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[Openshift documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/services/[container-engine documentation] for more information.

|=============
|Service        |Port  | Description

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}` | 8080 | The web server's HTTP port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-memcached` | 11211 | Memcached service for clustered applications.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-hotrod` | 11333 | Hot Rod service for clustered applications.
|=============



=== Routes

A route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally-reachable hostname such as `www.example.com`. A defined route and the endpoints
identified by its service can be consumed by a router to provide named connectivity from external clients to your applications. Each route consists
of a route name, service selector, and (optionally) security configuration. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|=============
| Service    | Security | Hostname

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-http` | none | `${HOSTNAME_HTTP}`

=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[Openshift documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-developer-guide#triggers[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}` | ImageChange
|============



==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/[container-engine documentation]
for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Replicas

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}` | 1

===== Service Accounts

Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project. They can be created or deleted like any other API object. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/service_accounts.html#managing-service-accounts[Openshift documentation] for more
information.
