Application template for JBoss A-MQ brokers.

toc::[]


== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|=======================================================================
|Variable name |Image Environment Variable |Description |Example value |Required

|`APPLICATION_NAME` | -- | The name for the application. | broker | True
|`MQ_PROTOCOL` | -- | Protocol to configure.  Only openwire is supported by EAP.  amqp, amqp+ssl, mqtt, stomp, stomp+ssl, and ssl are not supported by EAP | openwire | False
|`MQ_QUEUES` | `AMQ_QUEUES` | Queue names | `${MQ_QUEUES}` | False
|`MQ_TOPICS` | `AMQ_TOPICS` | Topic names | `${MQ_TOPICS}` | False
|`MQ_USERNAME` | `AMQ_USER` | Broker user name | `${MQ_USERNAME}` | False
|`MQ_PASSWORD` | `AMQ_PASSWORD` | Broker user password | `${MQ_PASSWORD}` | False
|`AMQ_ADMIN_USERNAME` | `AMQ_ADMIN_USERNAME` | A-MQ Admin User | `${AMQ_ADMIN_USERNAME}` | True
|`AMQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `AMQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | A-MQ Admin Password | `${AMQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD}` | True
|`AMQ_MESH_DISCOVERY_TYPE` | `AMQ_MESH_DISCOVERY_TYPE` | The discovery agent type to use for discovering mesh endpoints.  'dns' will use OpenShift's DNS service to resolve endpoints.  'kube' will use Kubernetes REST API to resolve service endpoints.  If using 'kube' the service account for the pod must have the 'view' role, which can be added via 'oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:default' where <namespace> is the project namespace. | kube | ?
|`AMQ_STORAGE_USAGE_LIMIT` | `AMQ_STORAGE_USAGE_LIMIT` | The A-MQ storage usage limit | 100 gb | ?
|`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE` | -- | Namespace in which the ImageStreams for Red Hat Middleware images are installed. These ImageStreams are normally installed in the openshift namespace. You should only need to modify this if you've installed the ImageStreams in a different namespace/project. | openshift | True

== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[Openshift documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/services/[container-engine documentation] for more information.

|=============
|Service        |Port  | Description

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-amqp` | 5672 | The broker's amqp port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-mqtt` | 1883 | The broker's mqtt port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-stomp` | 61613 | The broker's stomp port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-tcp` | 61616 | The broker's tcp (openwire) port.
|=============






=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[Openshift documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-developer-guide#triggers[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq` | ImageChange
|============



==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/[container-engine documentation]
for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Replicas

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq` | 1

===== Service Accounts

Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project. They can be created or deleted like any other API object. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/service_accounts.html#managing-service-accounts[Openshift documentation] for more
information.
