Application template for JBoss A-MQ brokers. These can be deployed as standalone or in a mesh. This template doesn't feature SSL support.

toc::[]


== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.okd.io/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[OKD documentation] for more information.

|=======================================================================
|Variable name |Image Environment Variable |Description |Example value |Required

|`APPLICATION_NAME` | -- | The name for the application. | broker | True
|`MQ_PROTOCOL` | -- | Protocols to configure, separated by commas. Allowed values are: `openwire`, `amqp`, `stomp` and `mqtt`. | openwire | False
|`MQ_QUEUES` | `AMQ_QUEUES` | Queue names, separated by commas. These queues will be automatically created when the broker starts. If left empty, queues will be still created dynamically. | `${MQ_QUEUES}` | False
|`MQ_TOPICS` | `AMQ_TOPICS` | Topic names, separated by commas. These topics will be automatically created when the broker starts. If left empty, topics will be still created dynamically. | `${MQ_TOPICS}` | False
|`MQ_SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES` | `MQ_SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES` | List of packages that are allowed to be serialized for use in ObjectMessage, separated by commas. If your app doesn't use ObjectMessages, leave this blank. This is a security enforcement. For the rationale, see http://activemq.apache.org/objectmessage.html | `${MQ_SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES}` | False
|`MQ_USERNAME` | `AMQ_USER` | User name for standard broker user. It is required for connecting to the broker. If left empty, it will be generated. | `${MQ_USERNAME}` | False
|`MQ_PASSWORD` | `AMQ_PASSWORD` | Password for standard broker user. It is required for connecting to the broker. If left empty, it will be generated. | `${MQ_PASSWORD}` | False
|`AMQ_MESH_DISCOVERY_TYPE` | `AMQ_MESH_DISCOVERY_TYPE` | The discovery agent type to use for discovering mesh endpoints.  'dns' will use OpenShift's DNS service to resolve endpoints.  'kube' will use Kubernetes REST API to resolve service endpoints.  If using 'kube' the service account for the pod must have the 'view' role, which can be added via 'oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:default' where <namespace> is the project namespace. | dns | False
|`AMQ_STORAGE_USAGE_LIMIT` | `AMQ_STORAGE_USAGE_LIMIT` | Sets the store disk limit usage in activemq.xml. If the value set is greater than the disk size, it will be resized to the available disk space. | 100 gb | False
|`AMQ_QUEUE_MEMORY_LIMIT` | `AMQ_QUEUE_MEMORY_LIMIT` | The queue memory limit (default is 1mb) | `${AMQ_QUEUE_MEMORY_LIMIT}` | False
|`IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE` | -- | Namespace in which the ImageStreams for Red Hat Middleware images are installed. These ImageStreams are normally installed in the openshift namespace. You should only need to modify this if you've installed the ImageStreams in a different namespace/project. | openshift | True
|=======================================================================



== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.okd.io/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[OKD documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://docs.okd.io/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[OKD documentation] for more information.

|=============
|Service        |Port  |Name | Description

.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-amqp`
|5672 | --
.1+| The broker's AMQP port.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-mqtt`
|1883 | --
.1+| The broker's MQTT port.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-stomp`
|61613 | --
.1+| The broker's STOMP port.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-tcp`
|61616 | --
.1+| The broker's OpenWire port.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-mesh`
|61616 | mesh
.1+| Supports node discovery for mesh formation.

=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.okd.io/latest/dev_guide/deployments/how_deployments_work.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[OKD documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://docs.okd.io/latest/dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.html#triggers[OKD documentation] for more information.

|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq` | ImageChange

==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://docs.okd.io/latest/dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.html#scaling[OKD documentation]
for more information.
