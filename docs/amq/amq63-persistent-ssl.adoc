Application template for JBoss A-MQ brokers. These are deployed as standalone and use persistent storage for saving messages, including message migration when the number of pods are reduced. This template supports SSL and requires usage of OpenShift secrets.

For SSL to work, you have to have keystore and truststore files. If you don't have them already, you can generate them using _keytool_ application which is part of Java distribution. Assuming that JAVA_HOME points to your Java distribution, open a working directory and run the commands from the command line.

1. Prepare variables

  BROKER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<password for broker keystore>
  BROKER_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=<password for broker truststore>
  CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<password for client keystore>


2. Create client keystore (optional - if you alredy have certificate for the client, proceed to step 4)

  $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool \
	-genkey \
	-keyalg RSA \
	-alias amq-client \
	-keystore amq-client.ks \
	-storepass $CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
    -keypass $CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD

3. Create client certificate (optional - if you alredy have certificate for the client, proceed to step 4)

  $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool \
	-export \
	-alias amq-client \
	-keystore amq-client.ks \
    -storepass $CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
	-file amq-client.cert

4. Create broker keystore

  $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool \
	-genkey \
	-keyalg RSA \
	-alias amq-broker \
	-keystore amq-broker.ks \
	-storepass $BROKER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
    -keypass $BROKER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD

5. Create broker truststore from client certificate

  $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool \
	-import \
	-alias amq-broker \
	-keystore amq-broker.ts \
	-file amq-client.cert \
	-storepass $BROKER_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD \
    -trustcacerts \
    -noprompt

Now, you can use files `amq-broker.ks` and `amq-broker.ts` in OpenShift secret definition. Leave the files `amq-client.ks` and `amq-client.cert` be as they are not needed by the broker. Also, when creating A-MQ application, set the template parameters as: +

AMQ_KEYSTORE=amq-broker.ks +
AMQ_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<password for broker keystore> +
AMQ_TRUSTSTORE=amq-broker.ts +
AMQ_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=<password for broker truststore> +

== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Openshift documentation] for more information.

== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[Openshift documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/services/[container-engine documentation] for more information.

=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[Openshift documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-developer-guide#triggers[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq` | ImageChange
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-drainer` | ImageChange
|============



==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/[container-engine documentation]
for more information.

==== Volume Claims

A `PersistentVolume` object is a storage resource in an OpenShift cluster. Storage is provisioned by an administrator
by creating `PersistentVolume` objects from sources such as GCE Persistent Disks, AWS Elastic Block Stores (EBS), and NFS mounts.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html#overview[Openshift documentation] for
more information.
