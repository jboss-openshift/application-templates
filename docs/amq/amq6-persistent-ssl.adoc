Application template for A-MQ brokers using persistent storage.


== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Openshift documentation] for more information.

== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[Openshift documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/services/[container-engine documentation] for more information.

|=============
|Service        |Port  | Description

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-amqp` | 5672 | The broker's amqp port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-amqp-ssl` | 5671 | The broker's amqp ssl port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-mqtt` | 1883 | The broker's mqtt port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-mqtt-ssl` | 8883 | The broker's mqtt ssl port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-stomp` | 61613 | The broker's stomp port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-stomp-ssl` | 61612 | The broker's stomp ssl port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-tcp` | 61616 | The broker's tcp (openwire) port.
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-tcp-ssl` | 61617 | The broker's tcp ssl (openwire) port.
|=============






=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[Openshift documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-developer-guide#triggers[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq` | ImageChange
|============



==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/[container-engine documentation]
for more information.

|Deployment | Replicas

===== Service Accounts

Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project. They can be created or deleted like any other API object. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/service_accounts.html#managing-service-accounts[Openshift documentation] for more
information.

=== External Dependencies


==== Volume Claims

A `PersistentVolume` object is a storage resource in an OpenShift cluster. Storage is provisioned by an administrator
by creating `PersistentVolume` objects from sources such as GCE Persistent Disks, AWS Elastic Block Stores (EBS), and NFS mounts.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html#overview[Openshift documentation] for
more information.

==== Secrets

This template requires link:../secrets/amq-app-secret.adoc[amq-app-secret.json]
to be installed for the application to run.
