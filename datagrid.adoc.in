For simple authentication, set

  USERNAME=<username>
  PASSWORD=<password>

This will enable user authentication with the datagrid. Provided username and password will be used to access the cache over both HTTPS and HotRod. With this case, the user will have all permissions configured.

Restrictions for password:

  at least 8 characters
  at least 1 digit
  at least 1 non-alphanumeric symbol
  must be different than username
  must not be root, admin, or administrator
